<b>Prepare the baking sheets.</b> Position a rack in the middle of the oven and 
preheat to 350. Line two rimless baking sheets with parchment baking paper.<p>
Mix the batter. In a bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat 
the egg until light. Gradually add the sugar, vanilla and lemon zest, beating 
after each addition. Continue beating until the batter is light and fluffy, 
about five minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the coconut. Drop by heaping 
teaspoonfuls of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 
1/2 inches apart. Put a teaspoonful of jam in the center of each cookie, 
creating a well with the spoon as you add the jam.</p>
<p>Bake until the cookies are golden brown on the edges, about15 minutes. Turn 
off the oven, and let the cookies dry in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Let the 
cookies cool on the baking sheets on wire racks for five minutes, and then 
transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.</p>
