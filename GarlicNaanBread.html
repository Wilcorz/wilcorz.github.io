<b>1 teaspoon dried active yeast<br>
1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>
1/2 cup warm water, about 110 degrees F<br>
1 Tablespoon garlic<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed while kneading<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 cup clarified butter or vegetable oil, plus 1 teaspoon </b></TD>

In a glass-measuring cup, combine the yeast and sugar. Add the water and stir 
well. Let rest until foamy, about 5 minutes. Sift together the flour and salt 
into a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the yeast 
mixture, oil and garlic into the center. Mix together with your fingers until a 
smooth dough forms, working in a small amount of additional flour as needed. 
Knead for 3 minutes. <br>
Oil a small bowl with the remaining butter or oil. Place the dough into the 
bowl, turning to coat, and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour. <br>
<b>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. </b><br>
Divide the dough into 6 pieces and gently roll into 6 circles on a lightly 
floured surface. Bake on a baking stone, or a lightly greased baking sheet, 
until just golden brown and puffed, about 12 minutes. <br>
Serve immediately. </TD></TR>
