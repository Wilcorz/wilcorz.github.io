		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>(I use the Costco 
		meatballs but if you want to make your own below is a recipe )</b></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If making your owm 
		meatballs:</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">2 lbs lean ground beef
		<br />
		1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumb <br />
		1/2 cup milk <br />
		2 eggs <br />
		1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or part garlic salt)</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><strong>Mushrooms:
		</strong><br />
		1 pound Portabella Mushrooms (sliced and then cut in half) <br />
		2 Tablespoons Butter</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><strong>Sauce </strong>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">1/4 cup butter <br />
		1/4 cup flour <br />
		1 -2 clove garlic, mashed <br />
		1 cup half-and-half cream <br />
		1 1/2 cups chicken broth <br />
		1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese (4 ounces) <br />
		chopped parsley or chives or green onion (garnish) (optional) <br />
		pepper or paprika (garnish) (optional) <br />
		<br />
		<b>(If using Costco meatballs just place in slow cooker and heat per 
		instructions. DO NOT add sauce until the meatballs are defrosted and 
		heated) <br />
		</b><br />
		<strong>If making your own Meatballs</strong>: Preheat oven to 5oo F.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Combine meat, crumbs, 
		milk, eggs and salt in a bowl. Mix lightly to blend. Shape into balls 
		about the size of marbles. (Makes about 100 meatballs). Arrange on 
		shallow, rimmed baking pans and bake for 4 to 5 minutes or until lightly 
		browned. <br />
		</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><strong>For Mushrooms:</strong> 
		Heat Butter in a large pan and add mushrooms. Cook until almost all 
		liquid is gone. Pour cooked mushrooms over meatballs (do not mix in 
		yet). Do not wash pan as you will use it to make the following sauce.<br />
		</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><strong>For Sauce:</strong> 
		Heat butter in a pan over medium heat, stir in the flour and mashed 
		garlic and cook until blended and bubbly. <i><b>( I usually cook this 
		until it has a nice roasted smell and is a medium brown in color) </b>
		</i>Gradually stir in the half&amp; half and chicken broth. Cook, stirring, 
		until thickened. (This can take about 15 minutes if you like a thick 
		sauce) Add the crumbled blue cheese and stir until blended. Add salt if 
		needed. (I do not add salt but do add pepper) </p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp;<br />
		<strong>To Serve </strong>(if made ahead): Refrigerate the meatballs and 
		sauce until time to serve. 6. Reheat meat and sauce together, covered, 
		over low heat, stirring gently several times (can use microwave).</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Sprinkle with garnish 
		just before serving. <br />
		<br />
		Keep warm in a crockpot or chafing dish.</p>
